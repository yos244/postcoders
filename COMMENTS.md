# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

please install: 
- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/style 
- npm install @material/card


if react is not defined please run this command and install react 
-  npm config set legacy-peer-deps true

- npm install react


- If I had more time I would have included error handling to the postcode textbox
- I woould have set a timer for cache to be wiped, as data might change 
- I would have styled the rendered cards to fit in the current page dimension
- I would have used React Query to store cache for more practical use
